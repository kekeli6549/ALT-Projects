    <h1>My Biography</h1>
<p>My life is simple. Childhood was nice and remarkable,it was my my most care momment. Everything was easy,no responsibility, no stress, even my work then was easy when i look at it with restrospect it was not hard at all</p>
As i grew older i understood what pain was life took its tole on me,joy was an emotion i didn't understood anymore.
as i grew older it became worse, i lacked happiness . Sadness and depression were my buddies,but at my lowest of lows i heard somethings that changed my thinking "Life Get's hard but that Shows your Growing"and "Crying Doesn't Show That Your Weak,it shows that you have been Strong for too long "><body>
   <p>So i am 17 now and i am full of life. I am about to become an adult and my life is just ahead of me. 
       And now i am taking this World with a smile.游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때"</p>
